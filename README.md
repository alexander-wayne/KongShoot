# Doot

Doot is a **SpriteKit** game on the App Store written in **Swift**.  It was inspired by the barrel mini games from Donkey Kong.

My goal for this game was to learn how to integrate various social REST API's into a native iOS app. I used the Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter API's to allow the player to easily share an image of their high score to their social media. I was successful, but several of my tokens have expired so they're no longer working. I may go in and fix them one of these day's, but we'll see.

I also integrated Google Ads to learn how it works.
